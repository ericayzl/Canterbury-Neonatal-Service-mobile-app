	<p style="padding-bottom: 2rem;";>Canterbury Neonatal Service prides itself on its multi-disciplinary approach and teamwork when caring for our babies/p&emacr;pi. We are constantly sustaining and improving our care for our community/takiwh&amacr;​​​.</p>

		<h2 class="h2-main-body-two">Level 3 (Intensive Care)</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">Our Level 3, or Intensive Care Area, provides care for babies/p&emacr;pi ​who need help with breathing (ventilator or CPAP) or have complex needs, including surgery. In addition, any baby that requires intensive observation will be cared for within this environment.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">The service utilises Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and various forms of ventilation (High Frequency and Nitric Oxide, Volume, and SIMV-Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) in supporting babies who are experiencing breathing difficulties or who require support post-surgery.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">Utilising the extended multi-disciplinary team, these babies are cared for in a physical environment that enables us to monitor their activity closely. Extremely sick or unwell babies are usually cared for by one Nurse who can solely focus on the baby's/p&emacr;pi's and family's/wh&amacr;nau​'s needs.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">Within our neonatal environment, the parents are valued team members. Staff will assist in any way possible to minimise separation and encourage contact. This often involves changing nappies, taking temperatures, and kangaroo care. The parents' role is highly valued.</p>
		<h2 class="h2-main-body">Level 2 (Special Care)</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">Our Level 2, or Special Care Area, provides support and care for babies/p&emacr;pi​ who can breathe for themselves but may still have special needs that require input from our multi-disciplinary team. These babies may require oxygen therapy, intravenous therapy, antibiotics, who are of a low birth weight, or are unable to keep warm or feed well.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">This area doesn't appear as "High Tech" as intensive care and encourages the family/wh&amacr;nau to participate more freely in caring for their baby/p&emacr;pi. In this situation, one Nurse will care for up to five babies.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">Babies often progress into room 6, where their care focuses more on the "well" baby, who perhaps remains a little small and begins to establish oral feeding. This nursery's physical surroundings allow and encourage families/wh&amacr;nau​ to achieve a high level of participation in the care of their baby/p&emacr;pi. Nurses at this level impart Parentcraft skills that will be of enormous value when the hospital discharges the babies into their home environment.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">Parent rooms are available when the baby/p&emacr;pi​​ ​ is close to discharge. We aim for all parents to room in with their baby/p&emacr;pi​​ for at least one night before discharge to enable parents to feel more confident on discharge. Our service provides meals for parents living in.</p>
