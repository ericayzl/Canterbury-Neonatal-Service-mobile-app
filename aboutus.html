		<h1 class="h1-main-body">About Us</h1>
		<p>Canterbury Neonatal Service provides 24-hour care for newborn babies with various special needs. Our care includes prematurity, surgery, congenital abnormalities, and babies who may have been compromised at birth. Canterbury Neonatal Service's skilled and experienced multi-disciplinary team provides care utilising current evidence-based practice.</p>	
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2 class="h2-main-body" style="padding-top: 2.4rem;">Geographic Span</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">Our service provides special and intensive care for all babies born in the wider Canterbury region. This region extends to Timaru in the South, Greymouth in the West, and Kaikoura in the North (approximately 20,000 square kilometres). </p>
		<p class="p-main-body">In addition, all newborn babies requiring surgery in the South Island, which is approximately 50,000 square kilometres (excluding the Nelson region), will be cared for within this service. If a baby requires cardiac surgery, then once stabilised, the team will transfer the baby to New Zealand's/Aotearoa's only Paediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit in Auckland.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">Given the large geographical area for which our service is responsible, a highly skilled Neonatal retrieval team is available 24 hours to transport babies to and from our tertiary referral centre in Christchurch/&Omacr;tautahi. However, the ambulance will arrive first when emergencies occur in a home setting. In 2009, approximately 100 transports were by helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, or ambulance.</p>
		<h2 class="h2-main-body">Our Hospital Care</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">The Neonatal Service currently provides ten intensive care cots and 28 Level 2 cots, a total of 38. In 2010, our service provided care to 830 newborn babies/p&emacr;pi. The babies' gestational age varied from less than 26 weeks to 42 weeks. The smallest baby we cared for weighed less than 500g.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">We recognise that breastfeeding is an integral part of our babies/p&emacr;pi's care. Our service facilitates and encourages breastfeeding following the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) joint statement in 1989. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) supports this.</p>
		<h2 class="h2-main-body">Research & Standards</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">Our care and service have a strong Nursing and Medical research philosophy. At any time, we have numerous consented studies or reviews in progress. Neonatal Research Nurses are employed to assist in managing some of the neonatal studies.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body">We use the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumer's Rights and The Treaty of Waitangi/ Te Tiriti o Waitangi to guide our care.</p>
		<h2 class="h2-main-body">Our Values</h2>
		<p class="p-main-body">Our service prides itself on its multi-disciplinary approach and teamwork when caring for the babies/p&emacr;pi and family/wh&amacr;nau of Canterbury/Waitaha. We are constantly sustaining and improving our care for our community/takiwh&amacr;​​​. Central to this is our reflective practice and our desire to base as much of our model of care as possible on current evidence-based practice.</p>

		<h1 style="padding-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.4rem;">Our Philosophy</h1>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We consistently provide quality holistic care as a team and respect for family/wh&amacr;nau.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We encompass the concepts of Te Whare Tapa Wh&amacr; <span class="important-names">(The four cornerstones of health)</span>, Te Taha Wairua <span class="important-names">(Spiritual)</span>, Te Taha Tinana <span class="important-names">(Physical)</span>, Te Taha Wh&amacr;nau <span class="important-names">(Family)</span>, and Te Taha Hinengaro <span class="important-names">(Emotional and psychological)</span>. </p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We follow Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi) and the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers Rights (1994).</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">By creating and maintaining an environment with developmentally supportive care, we maximise the baby's/p&emacr;pi's outcome and potential for a dignified and independent life.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We promote and foster healthy interpersonal relationships between nga m&amacr;tua/parents, extended family/wh&amacr;nau, and baby/p&emacr;pi.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We ensure the multi-disciplinary team advocates for the baby/p&emacr;pi and their family/wh&amacr;nau in all aspects of care, including complaints.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We encourage open and effective communication between all staff and family/wh&amacr;nau in a supportive, caring environment, providing interpretation when required, without discrimination.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We ensure appropriate preparation for discharge and provide advice on ongoing needs. Our multi-disciplinary team members will establish these needs in consultation with the family/wh&amacr;nau.</p>
		<p class="p-main-body-two">We recognise the necessity of maintaining high levels of care and skill within our service that uses evidence-based practice, current teaching, and research.</p>
