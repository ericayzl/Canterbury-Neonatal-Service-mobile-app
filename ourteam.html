We assess and diagnose neonatal abnormalities on several different forms of imaging. This most commonly includes neonatal X-rays and ultrasounds but may include CT, MRI, and fluoroscopy.

		<div class="panel">
			
			<p class="medicalHeading">Discharge Facilitator</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">The role of the discharge facilitator is to assist in the preparation of families transitioning to home. In particular, families with ongoing medical needs, such as home oxygen and tube feeding. Discharge facilitators are part of a multidisciplinary team caring for the family and liaise closely with the Neonatal Outreach Nurses. Contact details are 364 ​​4244 or pager numbers 5291 / 5487.</p>

			<p class="p-main-body">NICU Social Workers work with families providing emotional and practical support. We understand the complexity of the issues in the NICU. Our role is to walk beside families through the NICU journey to help reduce stress in the unit and at home.</p>

			<p class="medicalHeading">Dietitian</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">The Neonatal Dietitian is here to ensure your baby receives the best nutrition and will be monitoring your baby's growth and nutritional intake. She is on the morning ward rounds to look at growth charts and to discuss and implement feeding changes. If you have questions regarding what nutrition your baby is receiving or your baby's growth, then ask your nurse to contact the Dietitian, who can come and discuss this with you. The Dietitian can also advise breastfeeding mothers on their own nutrition, which can be an issue for many busy parents. She is available Monday to Friday.</p>
			
			<p class="medicalHeading">Hearing Screening Team</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">We offer hearing screening to all babies admitted to NICU as part of the national Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and Early Intervention Programme. At some point during a baby's NICU journey, parents/caregivers are given written information about the program. We have a team of four NICU nurses who complete the screening of the babies admitted to the NICU. </p>
			<p class="p-main-body">As a baby nears discharge home (usually after 36 weeks), one of the nurses on the hearing screening team will approach parents/caregivers to see if they would be interested in having their baby screened. It is an excellent opportunity for parents/caregivers to ask questions they may have about the screening. Hearing screening is a simple process; our team will give parents/caregivers the screening results immediately.</p>
			
			<p class="medicalHeading">Pharmacist</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">A Clinical Pharmacist visits the Neonatal Unit daily (Monday - Friday). The visit will usually include attending the ward round and providing medication dosing advice to the medical team and any parents with medication-related queries about their infant's care. As part of the ward visit, the pharmacist will also check medication charts to ensure that all prescriptions have been written correctly and that the medicines can be given safely and on time.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">Nearer to the time of discharge home, if your infant needs to be continue medicines at home, the pharmacist will help to ensure that this can happen as easily as possible. In some cases, discharge medicines may need to be dispensed from the hospital pharmacy rather than your local community pharmacy after discharge. The Neonatal Clinical Pharmacist and Discharge Facilitator can advise you if this is the case. During your infant's stay in the NICU, please ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medication you think they may be able to help with.
</p>
			
			<p class="medicalHeading">Physiotherapist</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">Physiotherapists assess infants' development, head shape, range of movement, and muscle strength, meet with parents for specific handling and positioning sessions, discuss developmental play ideas, and liaise with community therapists if infants have ongoing needs. Physiotherapists also run a developmental playgroup for preterm infants to ensure the achievement of developmental milestones in the first year of life.</p>
			
			<p class="medicalHeading">Speech Language Therapy</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">A Speech Language Therapy service is available to all babies admitted to the NICU. We offer a Monday-to-Friday service, and three therapists are currently on the unit. Speech Language Therapists assess your baby's sucking and feeding skills and will create individual feeding plans to help with his or her sucking and feeding. For those babies that are bottle-fed, we may recommend specialist teats.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">We also work with the infant feeding specialist, the physiotherapist, and the medical team to advise feeding positions and routines. We usually see babies born early, those with syndromes, cleft palate, or any baby having difficulty feeding. Babies can have feeding difficulties for various reasons, so our involvement may be for a short or long time. For babies in the NICU for a long time, we also advise about early communication development. Outpatient follow-up is also available once your baby has gone home.</p>

			<p class="p-main-body">The <span class="medicalHeading">Christchurch Women's Neonatal Transport Team</span> covers retrievals of newborn, premature, and sick babies from Kaikoura to the West Coast and down to Timaru, as not all hospitals have the resources to care for preterm or sick babies. The team also covers retrieving babies requiring surgical intervention from Nelson to Invercargill and taking them to Christchurch Women's Hospital, the only hospital that provides surgical services to neonates in the South Island.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">​​​​​The transport team may also collect preterm or sick babies from other hospitals around New Zealand if the retrieval team from the referring hospital cannot do the transport. The transport team will also transfer babies back to their home hospitals once they are well enough and are almost ready for discharge home.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">The Neonatal Emergency Transport Team aims to provide the same specialised care to newborn, premature, and sick babies as they would receive within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit environment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The team is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">The transport team comprises a dedicated team of specially trained Registered Nurses/Midwives, a Clinical Nurse Specialist/Advanced Nurse Practitioner, and a Neonatal Registrar.</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">Our service transports the babies by Road Ambulance (St John), Fixed Wing Aircraft (New Zealand Flying Doctors), or Helicopter (Garden City Helicopter).</p>
			<p class="p-main-body">The Neonatal Transport Team does between 60-80 emergency retrievals a year and 40 transfers of babies back to their home hospital. About half of the transports are by ambulance, half by fixed wing, and only a few by helicopter.</p>
